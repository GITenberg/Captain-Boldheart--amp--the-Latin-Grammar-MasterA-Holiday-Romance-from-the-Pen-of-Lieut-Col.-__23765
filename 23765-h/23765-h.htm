<h3>FOREWORD</h3>


<p>The story contained herein was
written by Charles Dickens in
1867. It is the third of four stories
entitled "Holiday Romance" and was published
originally in a children's magazine
in America. It purports to be written by a
child aged nine. It was republished in
England in "All the Year Round" in
1868. For this and four other Christmas
pieces Dickens received &pound;1,000.</p>

<p>"Holiday Romance" was published in
book form by Messrs Chapman &amp; Hall
in 1874, with "Edwin Drood" and other
stories.</p>

<p>For this reprint the text of the story as
it appeared in "All the Year Round" has

<h3>CAPTAIN BOLDHEART AND<br />
THE LATIN-GRAMMAR MASTER</h3>


<p>The subject of our present narrative would
appear to have devoted himself to the Pirate
profession at a comparatively early age. We
find him in command of a splendid schooner of one
hundred guns, loaded to the muzzle, 'ere yet he had
had a party in honour of his tenth birthday.</p>

<p>It seems that our hero, considering himself spited
by a Latin-Grammar-Master, demanded the satisfaction
due from one man of honour to another. Not
getting it, he privately withdrew his haughty spirit
from such low company, bought a second-hand
pocket-pistol, folded up some sandwiches in a paper
bag, made a bottle of Spanish liquorice-water, and
entered on a career of valour.</p>

<p>It were tedious to follow Boldheart (for such was his
name) through the commencing stages of his history.
Suffice it that we find him bearing the rank of Captain
Boldheart, reclining in full uniform on a crimson<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[Pg 6]</a></span>
hearth-rug spread out upon the quarter-deck of his
schooner the Beauty, in the China Seas. It was a
lovely evening, and as his crew lay grouped about
him, he favoured them with the following melody:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">O landsmen are folly!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">O Pirates are jolly!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">O Diddleum Dolly,<br /></span>
<span class="i6">Di!<br /></span>
<span class="i2">(<i>Chorus</i>) Heave yo.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>The soothing effect of these animated sounds floating
over the waters, as the common sailors united
their rough voices to take up the rich tones of Boldheart,
may be more easily conceived than described.</p>

<p>It was under these circumstances that the lookout
at the masthead gave the word, "Whales!"</p>

<p>All was now activity.</p>

<p>"Where away?" cried Captain Boldheart, starting up.</p>

<p>"On the larboard bow, sir," replied the fellow at
the masthead, touching his hat. For such was the
height of discipline on board of the Beauty, that even
at that height he was obliged to mind it or be shot
through the head.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[Pg 7]</a></span></p><p>"This adventure belongs to me," said Boldheart.
"Boy, my harpoon. Let no man follow;" and leaping
alone into his boat, the captain rowed with admirable
dexterity in the direction of the monster.</p>

<p>All was now excitement.</p>

<p>"He nears him!" said an elderly seaman, following
the captain through his spy-glass.</p>

<p>"He strikes him!" said another seaman, a mere stripling,
but also with a spy-glass.</p>

<p>"He tows him towards us!" said another seaman, a
man in the full vigour of life, but also with a spy-glass.</p>

<p>In fact the captain was seen approaching, with the
huge bulk following. We will not dwell on the deafening
cries of "Boldheart! Boldheart!" with which he
was received, when, carelessly leaping on the quarter-deck,
he presented his prize to his men. They afterwards
made two thousand four hundred and seventeen
pound ten and sixpence by it.</p>

<p>Ordering the sails to be braced up, the captain now
stood W.N.W. The Beauty flew rather than floated
over the dark blue waters. Nothing particular occurred
for a fortnight, except taking, with considerable<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</a></span>
slaughter, four Spanish galleons, and a Snow from
South America, all richly laden. Inaction began to
tell upon the spirits of the men. Captain Boldheart
called all hands aft, and said:</p>

<p>"My lads, I hear there are discontented ones among
ye. Let any such stand forth."</p>

<p>After some murmuring, in which the expressions,
"Aye, aye, sir!" "Union Jack!" "Avast," "Starboard,"
"Port," "Bowsprit," and similar indications
of a mutinous undercurrent, though subdued, were
audible, Bill Boozey, captain of the foretop, came out
from the rest. His form was that of a giant, but he
quailed under the captain's eye.</p>

<p>"What are your wrongs?" said the captain.</p>

<p>"Why, d'ye see, Captain Boldheart," replied the
towering mariner, "I've sailed man and boy for many
a year, but I never yet know'd the milk served out
for the ship's company's teas to be so sour as 'tis
aboard this craft."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[Pg 9]</a></span></p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 304px;">
<img src="images/illus03.png" width="304" height="500" alt="The Rescue of William
Boozey." title="" />
<span class="caption">The Rescue of William Boozey.</span>
</div>

<p>At this moment the thrilling cry, "Man overboard!"
announced to the astonished crew that Boozey, in
stepping back, as the captain (in mere thoughtfulness)<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</a></span>
laid his hand upon the faithful pocket-pistol which
he wore in his belt, had lost his balance, and was
struggling with the foaming tide.</p>

<p>All was now stupefaction.</p>

<p>But, with Captain Boldheart, to throw off his uniform
coat regardless of the various rich orders with
which it was decorated, and to plunge into the sea
after the drowning giant, was the work of a moment.
Maddening was the excitement when boats were
lowered; intense the joy when the captain was seen
holding up the drowning man with his teeth; deafening
the cheering when both were restored to the
main deck of the Beauty. And from the instant of his
changing his wet clothes for dry ones, Captain Boldheart
had no such devoted though humble friend as
William Boozey.</p>

<p>Boldheart now pointed to the horizon, and called
the attention of his crew to the taper spars of a ship
lying snug in harbour under the guns of a fort.</p>

<p>"She shall be ours at sunrise," said he. "Serve out
a double allowance of grog, and prepare for action."</p>

<p>All was now preparation.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</a></span></p>

<p>When morning dawned after a sleepless night, it was
seen that the stranger was crowding on all sail to come
out of the harbour and offer battle. As the two ships
came nearer to each other, the stranger fired a gun
and hoisted Roman colours. Boldheart then perceived
her to be the Latin-Grammar-Master's bark. Such indeed
she was, and had been tacking about the world
in unavailing pursuit, from the time of his first taking
to a roving life.</p>

<p>Boldheart now addressed his men, promising to
blow them up if he should feel convinced that their
reputation required it, and giving orders that the
Latin-Grammar-Master should be taken alive. He
then dismissed them to their quarters, and the fight
began with a broadside from The Beauty. She then
veered round, and poured in another. The Scorpion
(so was the bark of the Latin-Grammar-Master appropriately
called) was not slow to return her fire, and
a terrific cannonading ensued, in which the guns of
The Beauty did tremendous execution.</p>

<p>The Latin-Grammar-Master was seen upon the
poop, in the midst of the smoke and fire, encouraging<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</a></span>
his men. To do him justice, he was no Craven, though
his white hat, his short grey trousers, and his long
snuff-coloured surtout reaching to his heels&mdash;the self-same
coat in which he had spited Boldheart&mdash;contrasted
most unfavourably with the brilliant uniform
of the latter. At this moment Boldheart, seizing a
pike and putting himself at the head of his men, gave
the word to board.</p>

<p>A desperate conflict ensued in the hammock nettings&mdash;or
somewhere in about that direction&mdash;until
the Latin-Grammar-Master, having all his masts
gone, his hull and rigging shot through and through,
and seeing Boldheart slashing a path towards him,
hauled down his flag himself, gave up his sword to
Boldheart, and asked for quarter. Scarce had he been
put into the captain's boat, 'ere The Scorpion went
down with all on board.</p>

<p>On Captain Boldheart's now assembling his men, a
circumstance occurred. He found it necessary with
one blow of his cutlass to kill the Cook, who, having
lost his brother in the late action, was making at the
Latin-Grammar-Master in an infuriated state, intent
on his destruction with a carving-knife.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</a></span></p>

<p>Captain Boldheart then turned to the Latin-Grammar-Master,
severely reproaching him with his perfidy,
and put it to his crew what they considered
that a master who spited a boy deserved?</p>

<p>They answered with one voice, "Death."</p>

<p>"It may be so," said the Captain; "but it shall never
be said that Boldheart stained his hour of triumph
with the blood of his enemy. Prepare the cutter."</p>

<p>The cutter was immediately prepared.</p>

<p>"Without taking your life," said the Captain, "I
must yet for ever deprive you of the power of spiting
other boys. I shall turn you adrift in this boat. You
will find in her two oars, a compass, a bottle of rum,
a small cask of water, a piece of pork, a bag of biscuit,
and my Latin grammar. Go! and spite the natives, if
you can find any."</p>

<p>Deeply conscious of this bitter sarcasm, the unhappy
wretch was put into the cutter, and was soon left far
behind. He made no effort to row, but was seen lying
on his back with his legs up, when last made out by
the ship's telescopes.</p>

<p>A stiff breeze now beginning to blow, Captain Bold<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</a></span>heart
gave orders to keep her S.S.W., easing her a
little during the night by falling off a point or two
W. by W., or even by W.S., if she complained much.
He then retired for the night, having in truth much
need of repose. In addition to the fatigues he had undergone,
this brave officer had received sixteen
wounds in the engagement, but had not mentioned it.</p>

<p>In the morning a white squall came on, and was
succeeded by other squalls of various colours. It
thundered and lightened heavily for six weeks. Hurricanes
then set in for two months. Waterspouts and
tornadoes followed. The oldest sailor on board&mdash;and
he was a very old one&mdash;had never seen such weather.
The Beauty lost all idea where she was, and the
carpenter reported six feet two of water in the hold.
Everybody fell senseless at the pumps every day.</p>

<p>Provisions now ran very low. Our hero put the crew
on short allowance, and put himself on shorter allowance
than any man in the ship. But his spirit kept
him fat. In this extremity, the gratitude of Boozey,
the captain of the foretop whom our readers may remember,
was truly affecting. The loving though lowly<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</a></span>
William repeatedly requested to be killed, and preserved
for the captain's table.</p>

<p>We now approach a change in affairs.</p>

<p>One day during a gleam of sunshine and when the
weather had moderated, the man at the masthead&mdash;too
weak now to touch his hat, besides its having been
blown away&mdash;called out,</p>

<p>"Savages!"</p>

<p>All was now expectation.</p>

<p>Presently fifteen hundred canoes, each paddled by
twenty savages, were seen advancing in excellent
order. They were a light green colour (the Savages
were), and sang, with great energy, the following
strain:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Choo a choo a choo tooth.<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Muntch, muntch. Nycey!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Choo a choo a choo tooth.<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Muntch, muntch. Nyce!<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>As the shades of night were by this time closing in,
these expressions were supposed to embody this simple
people's views of the Evening Hymn. But it too soon<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</a></span>
appeared that the song was a translation of "For
what we are going to receive," &amp;c.</p>

<p>The chief, imposingly decorated with feathers of
lively colours, and having the majestic appearance of
a fighting Parrot, no sooner understood (he understood
English perfectly) that the ship was The
Beauty, Captain Boldheart, than he fell upon his face
on the deck, and could not be persuaded to rise until
the captain had lifted him up, &amp; told him he wouldn't
hurt him. All the rest of the savages also fell on their
faces with marks of terror, and had also to be lifted up
one by one. Thus the fame of the great Boldheart had
gone before him, even among these children of Nature.</p>

<p>Turtles and oysters were now produced in astonishing
numbers, and on these and yams the people made
a hearty meal. After dinner the Chief told Captain
Boldheart that there was better feeding up at the
village, and that he would be glad to take him and his
officers there. Apprehensive of treachery, Boldheart
ordered his boat's crew to attend him completely
armed. And well were it for other commanders if
their precautions&mdash;but let us not anticipate.</p>


<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</a></span></p><div class="figcenter" style="width: 396px;">

Before Putting Him To The Fire.&quot;</span>
</div><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</a></span></p>

<p>When the canoes arrived at the beach, the darkness
of the night was illumined by the light of an immense
fire. Ordering his boat's crew (with the intrepid though
illiterate William at their head) to keep close and be
upon their guard, Boldheart bravely went on, arm-in-arm
with the Chief.</p>

<p>But how to depict the captain's surprise when he
found a ring of Savages singing in chorus that barbarous
translation of "For what we are going to receive,
&amp;c.," which has been given above, and dancing
hand-in-hand round the Latin-Grammar-Master, in a
hamper with his head shaved, while two savages floured
him, before putting him to the fire to be cooked!</p>

<p>Boldheart now took counsel with his officers on the
course to be adopted. In the mean time, the miserable
captive never ceased begging pardon and imploring to
be delivered. On the generous Boldheart's proposal, it
was at length resolved that he should not be cooked,
but should be allowed to remain raw, on two conditions.
Namely,</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>1. That he should never under any circumstances
presume to teach any boy any thing any more.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</a></span></p>

<p>2. That, if taken back to England, he should pass
his life in travelling to find out boys who wanted
their exercises done, and should do their exercises for
those boys for nothing, and never say a word about
it.</p></div>

<p>Drawing his sword from its sheath, Boldheart swore
him to these conditions on its shining blade. The
prisoner wept bitterly, and appeared acutely to feel
the errors of his past career.</p>

<p>The captain then ordered his boat's crew to make
ready for a volley, and after firing to re-load quickly.
"And expect a score or two on ye to go head over
heels," murmured William Boozey; "for I'm a looking
at ye." With those words the derisive though
deadly William took a good aim.</p>

<p>"Fire!"</p>

<p>The ringing voice of Boldheart was lost in the report
of the guns and the screeching of the savages. Volley
after volley awakened the numerous echoes. Hundreds
of savages were killed, hundreds wounded, and thousands
ran howling into the woods. The Latin-Grammar-Master
had a spare night-cap lent him, and a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</a></span>
longtail coat which he wore hind side before. He presented
a ludicrous though pitiable appearance, and
serve him right.</p>

<p>We now find Captain Boldheart, with this rescued
wretch on board, standing off for other islands. At
one of these, not a cannibal island, but a pork and
vegetable one, he married (only in fun on his part)
the King's daughter. Here he rested some time, receiving
from the natives great quantities of precious stones,
gold dust, elephants' teeth, and sandal wood, and
getting very rich. This, too, though he almost every
day made presents of enormous value to his men.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</a></span></p>

<span class="caption">&quot;Ere The Sun Went Down Full Many A
Hornpipe Had Been Danced ... By The Uncouth Though Agile William.&quot;</span>
</div>



<p>The ship being at length as full as she could hold
of all sorts of valuable things, Boldheart gave orders
to weigh the anchor, and turn the Beauty's head
towards England. These orders were obeyed with
three cheers, and ere the sun went down full many
a hornpipe had been danced on deck by the uncouth
though agile William.</p>

<p>We next find Captain Boldheart about three leagues
off Madeira, surveying through his spy-glass a stranger
of suspicious appearance making sail towards him.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</a></span>
On his firing a gun ahead of her to bring her to, she
ran up a flag, which he instantly recognized as the
flag from the mast in the back-garden at home.</p>

<p>Inferring from this, that his father had put to sea to
seek his long-lost son, the captain sent his own boat
on board the stranger, to inquire if this was so, and
if so, whether his father's intentions were strictly
honourable. The boat came back with a present of
greens and fresh meat, and reported that the stranger
was The Family of twelve hundred tons, and had
not only the captain's father on board, but also his
mother, with the majority of his aunts and uncles,
and all his cousins. It was further reported to Boldheart
that the whole of these relations had expressed
themselves in a becoming manner, and were anxious
to embrace him and thank him for the glorious credit
he had done them. Boldheart at once invited them
to breakfast next morning on board the Beauty, and
gave orders for a brilliant ball that should last all day.</p>

<p>It was in the course of the night that the captain
discovered the hopelessness of reclaiming the Latin-Grammar-Master.
That thankless traitor was found<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</a></span>
out, as the two ships lay near each other, communicating
with The Family by signals, and offering
to give up Boldheart. He was hanged at the yard-arm
the first thing in the morning, after having it
impressively pointed out to him by Boldheart that
this was what spiters came to.</p>

<p>The meeting between the captain and his parents
was attended with tears. His uncles and aunts would
have attended their meeting with tears too, but he
wasn't going to stand that. His cousins were very much
astonished by the size of his ship and the discipline
of his men, and were greatly overcome by the
splendour of his uniform. He kindly conducted them
round the vessel, and pointed out every thing worthy
of notice. He also fired his hundred guns, and found
it amusing to witness their alarm.</p>

<p>The entertainment surpassed everything ever seen
on board ship, and lasted from ten in the morning
until seven the next morning. Only one disagreeable
incident occurred. Captain Boldheart found himself
obliged to put his cousin Tom in irons, for being disrespectful.
On the boy's promising amendment, how<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</a></span>ever,
he was humanely released after a few hours' close
confinement.</p>

<p>Boldheart now took his mother down into the great
cabin, and asked after the young lady with whom, it
was well known to the world, he was in love. His
mother replied that the object of his affections was
then at school at Margate, for the benefit of sea-bathing
(it was the month of September), but that she
feared the young lady's friends were still opposed to
the union. Boldheart at once resolved, if necessary, to
bombard the town.</p>

<p>Taking the command of his ship with this intention,
and putting all but fighting men on board The
Family, with orders to that vessel to keep in company,
Boldheart soon anchored in Margate Roads.
Here he went ashore well-armed, and attended by
his boat's crew (at their head the faithful though ferocious
William), and demanded to see the Mayor, who
came out of his office.</p>

<p>"Dost know the name of yon ship, Mayor?" asked
Boldheart fiercely.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</a></span></p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 500px;">
<img src="images/illus09.png" width="500" height="508" alt="&quot;Dost Know The Name Of Yon Ship, Mayor?&quot;" title="" />
<span class="caption">&quot;Dost Know The Name Of Yon Ship, Mayor?&quot;</span>
</div>


<p>"No," said the Mayor, rubbing his eyes, which he<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</a></span>
could scarce believe when he saw the goodly vessel
riding at anchor.</p>

<p>"She is named the Beauty," said the captain.</p>

<p>"Hah!" exclaimed the Mayor, with a start. "And
you, then, are Captain Boldheart?"</p>

<p>"The same."</p>

<p>A pause ensued. The Mayor trembled.</p>

<p>"Now, Mayor," said the captain, "choose. Help me
to my Bride, or be bombarded."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</a></span></p>


<div class="figcenter" style="width: 301px;">

<span class="caption">Standing Sentry Over Him</span>
</div>


<p>The Mayor begged for two hours' grace, in which
to make inquiries respecting the young lady. Boldheart
accorded him but one; and during that one
placed William Boozey sentry over him, with a drawn
sword and instructions to accompany him wherever
he went, and to run him through the body if he
showed a sign of playing false.</p>

<p>At the end of the hour, the Mayor re-appeared more
dead than alive, closely waited on by Boozey more
alive than dead.</p>

<p>"Captain," said the Mayor, "I have ascertained that
the young lady is going to bathe. Even now she waits
her turn for a machine. The tide is low, though rising.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[Pg 29]</a></span>
I, in one of our town-boats, shall not be suspected.
When she comes forth in her bathing-dress into the
shallow water from behind the hood of the machine,
my boat shall intercept her and prevent her return.
Do you the rest."</p>

<p>"Mayor," returned Capt. Boldheart, "thou hast
saved thy town."</p>

<p>The captain then signalled his boat to take him off,
and steering her himself ordered her crew to row
towards the bathing-ground, and there to rest upon
their oars. All happened as had been arranged. His
lovely bride came forth, the Mayor glided in behind
her, she became confused and had floated out of her
depth, when, with one skilful touch of the rudder
and one quivering stroke from the boat's crew, her
adoring Boldheart held her in his strong arms. There
her shrieks of terror were changed to cries of joy.</p>

<p>Before the Beauty could get under weigh, the
hoisting of all the flags in the town and harbour, and
the ringing of all the bells, announced to the brave
Boldheart that he had nothing to fear. He therefore
determined to be married on the spot, and signalled<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</a></span>
for a clergyman and clerk, who came off promptly
in a sailing-boat named the Skylark. Another great
entertainment was then given on board the Beauty,
in the midst of which the Mayor was called out by a
messenger. He returned with the news that Government
had sent down to know whether Captain Boldheart,
in acknowledgment of the great services he
had done his country by being a Pirate, would consent
to be made a Lieutenant-Colonel. For himself
he would have spurned the worthless boon, but his
Bride wished it and he consented.</p>

<p>Only one thing further happened before the good
ship Family was dismissed, with rich presents to all
on board. It is painful to record (but such is human
nature in some cousins) that Captain Boldheart's unmannerly
cousin Tom was actually tied up to receive
three dozen with a rope's end "for cheekyness and
making games," when Captain Boldheart's lady begged
for him and he was spared. The Beauty then refitted,
and the Captain and his Bride departed for the
Indian Ocean to enjoy themselves for evermore.</p>

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all

LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR

Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
